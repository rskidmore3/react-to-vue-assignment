## Font
I selected Cormorant SC because of its thin and classy look. The obvious choice would have been a digital looking font because of games 8 bit history, but I wanted a library look because this could become a library of games. 

## Data Structure 
- Name: String
- Publisher: String
- Rating: Number. A number was the best choice because sorting will be simpler to set up.
